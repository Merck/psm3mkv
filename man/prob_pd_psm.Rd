\title{Calculate membership probability of progressed disease state in a partitioned survival model}
\usage{
prob_pd_psm(time, dpam, starting = c(1, 0, 0))
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Time (numeric and vectorized)}

\item{dpam}{List of survival regressions for model endpoints. This must include progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).}

\item{starting}{Vector of membership probabilities (PF, PD, death) at time zero.}
}
\value{
Numeric value
}
\description{
Calculates membership probability of having progressed disease at a particular time (vectorized), given the partitioned survival model with certain statistical distributions and parameters.
