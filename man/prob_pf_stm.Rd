\title{Calculate probability of being progression free in either state transition model (clock forward or clock reset)}
\usage{
prob_pf_stm(time, dpam, starting = c(1, 0, 0))
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Time (numeric and vectorized)}

\item{dpam}{List of survival regressions for model endpoints. This must include pre-progression death (PPD) and time to progression (TTP).}

\item{starting}{Vector of membership probabilities (PF, PD, death) at time zero.}
}
\value{
Numeric value
}
\description{
Calculates membership probability for the progression free state, at a particular time (vectorized), given either state transition model (clock forward or clock reset) with given statistical distributions and parameters.
