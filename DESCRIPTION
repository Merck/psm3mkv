Description: Fits and evaluates three-state partitioned survival analyses
    (PartSAs) and Markov models (clock forward or clock reset) to
    progression and overall survival data typically collected in oncology clinical trials. These model structures are typically considered in
    cost-effectiveness modeling in advanced/metastatic cancer indications.
